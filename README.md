# dandydomains

I wanted to make an app using different APIs and data-sources and so this was made!
The generation of the domains is done using node.js as I wanted to have a play with that too.

#### APIs:
+ Wikipedia - domain suffix list
+ Domainr - domain availability
+ wordnik - word definitions

will be replacing the php stuff with node.js implementations
