# dandydomains

I wanted to make an app using different APIs and data-sources and so this was made!
The generation of the domains is done using nNde.js as I wanted to have a play with that too.

#### APIs:
+ Wikipedia - domain suffix list
+ Domainr - domain availability
+ Wordnik - word definitions

Will be replacing the php stuff with Node.js implementations...
